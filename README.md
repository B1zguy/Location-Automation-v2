v2 is a reimplementation of the original Location Automation. This version reworks atleast half the codebase to sport:
 
 - Command line interface
 - Updated integration with car logger data
 - Deprecation of Pandas methods
 - Timezone awareness

This was all done because the friend - whom requested the original project - wanted to use it for the current tax time.
